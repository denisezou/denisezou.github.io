This is the portfolio for the Coding Bootcamp (January-July 2019) at Northwestern University. 

You will find that the styling uses Bootstrap and a personal CSS stylesheet.

The projects from the 1st and 2nd milestones of the course may be found on the Portfolio page.

The links to my personal websites may be found in the navbar. 

This page is for educational purposes only. 

I am not seeking jobs outside of Northwestern University at this time.
